Blitz is a financial application designed to optimize credit card usage at various retail outlets. This is achieved by leveraging geolocation data through the Google Places API to identify the nearest stores. An algorithm is then employed to analyze each credit card's cash back percentage and points earned per purchase, ultimately determining the most advantageous card to use. This analytical process is facilitated by extracting relevant statistics from the Google Places API, enabling us to pinpoint the closest establishment, and by utilizing the OpenAI API to ascertain the merchant code of each store and cross-referencing it with the available credit card benefits to find the best one.
